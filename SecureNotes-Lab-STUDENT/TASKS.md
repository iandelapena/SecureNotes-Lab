# Combined Lab — Checklist

## Part A — make the security real (`app/main.py`)
- [x] **TASK 1 (A04)** hash_password / verify_password use bcrypt
- [x] **TASK 2 (A07)** create_token / read_token use a signed, expiring JWT
- [x] **TASK 3 (A07)** get_current_user raises 401 on a bad/expired token or unknown user (fail closed)
- [x] **TASK 4 (A01)** get_note returns 403 when the note isn't the caller's
- [x] **TASK 5 (A01)** /admin/users requires the admin role and never returns the password column

## Part B — write the tests (`tests/`)
API (`test_api.py`)
- [x] home endpoint returns the expected successful response
- [x] register then login returns a JWT (three dotted parts)
- [x] wrong password returns 401
- [x] create a note, then see it in your list

Security (`test_security.py`)
- [x] bad token rejected (401)
- [x] a user can't read another's note (403)  ← A01
- [x] a user can read their own note (200)
- [x] same login error for bad user vs bad password  ← A07
- [x] a non-admin can't list users (403)  ← A01
- [x] admin list has no password field  ← A04

**Goal:** all 5 tasks done AND all 11 tests green (`python -m pytest -q`). Then run
`python -m pytest --cov=app .`.

The complete suite contains 11 independent tests and uses the fresh-database fixture for every
test.

## Reflection (4–5 sentences)
Pick one security test. Explain what it checks, which OWASP risk it guards, and what would break in the
app if a teammate deleted that one check.

The unauthorized note access test checks that a user cannot read another user's note. It guards against
broken access control (A01), because the API must check the note owner instead of trusting the note ID.
If the ownership check were deleted, Alice could read Bob's private notes by requesting their IDs.
The test makes this security rule visible and helps prevent the mistake from returning in a later change.

## Part C — peer review and submission
- [x] Work is on the `secure-and-test` branch
- [ ] Open a pull request from `secure-and-test` into `main`
- [ ] Review a classmate's pull request with comments and an Approve or Request changes verdict
- [ ] Submit the repository, own pull request, and reviewed pull request links through the LMS

The GitHub peer-review steps remain pending until they are completed on GitHub; no review links are
invented here.
